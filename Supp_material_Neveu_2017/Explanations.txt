The supplementary files to Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta article "Aqueous Geochemistry in Icy World Interiors: Equilibrium Fluid, Rock, and Gas Compositions, and Fate of Antifreezes and Radionuclides" by Marc Neveu, Steven J Desch, and Julie C Castillo-Rogez comprise:

1. core10.dat, the PHREEQC database, whose compilation and validation is described in the article;
2. core10_output_list.txt, which lists the quantities output by the IPhreeqc routine in the Output_xx_xxx.txt files (each line corresponds to a column in those files);
3. Sol_H2O.txt and Sol_Comet.txt, which describe the input solutions (pure water and cometary fluid, respectively) and selected outputs on the speciation of those solutions prior to equilibrium with solids;
4. PHREEQC_input_xx_xx.txt, which describe the input solutions, input solid assemblages, and selected outputs for the equilibrium solution, solids, and gases. "OC" refers to ordinary chondrite, "CC" to carbonaceous (CM) chondrite, "H2O" to pure water, and "Comet" to cometary fluid;
5. Output_xx_xx.txt, the output files. Each column corresponds to an output listed in core10_output_list; each row corresponds to a simulation at given temperature, pressure, water:rock ratio, and redox (pe).
